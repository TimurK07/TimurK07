# Timur Kaliev (Frondixx)

Frontend Developer · 18 · Pavlodar, Kazakhstan

I build user-focused web interfaces and enjoy turning ideas into clean, working products. My main focus is frontend development, but I’m also interested in AI and blockchain-related technologies.

## Stack

**Language:** JavaScript
**Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Next.js, TanStack Query, Zustand

## Experience

I started programming with Python, which helped me understand the basics of logic and problem-solving. Later, I switched to JavaScript and frontend development, where I found my true interest.

My first commercial project came from freelancing — a website for purchasing tickets in the UAE. After that, I worked as a freelancer for about a year, gaining hands-on experience with real clients and deadlines.

I also participated in Google hackathons and national-level hackathons, where I took prize-winning places. Additionally, I have around one year of experience working in a company environment.
